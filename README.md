# Loan-Approval-Prediction
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts loan approval based on applicant details. It automates decision-making, reduces manual effort, improves accuracy, and helps financial institutions evaluate loan applications quickly and objectively.
# features
-Predicts loan approval(Yes/No)

-processes applicant details

-uses ML classification model

-Evaluation with accuracy and confusion matrix

-simple input-based prediction script

# Tools used
-python

-github

# Steps to Install & Run

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone <repo-link>
   
2. install dependencies:
   pip install-r requirement.txt

3. Train the model:
   python training.py
   
4. Run predictions:
   python predict.py

# Instruction for testing

- Enter sample applicant details when prompted.

- check prediction output(Approved/Rejected).

- Review accuracy from evaluation results.

- Try multiple inputs to confirm model behaviour.
