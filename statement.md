#  Problem Statement 

Banks receive many loan applications every day, and checking each one manually takes time and may lead to mistakes. Applicants differ in income, loan amount, employment status, and credit history. Without an automated system, loan decisions can be slow and inconsistent.
This project aims to build a simple machine learning model that predicts whether a loan should be approved or rejected based on applicant details. The goal is to make loan evaluation faster, more accurate, and data-driven.

 # Scope of the project

 The project focuses on using machine learning to predict loan eligibility.
It includes:

-Collecting and preparing applicant data

-Selecting useful features like income, loan amount, and credit history

-Training a Logistic Regression model

-Testing and evaluating accuracy

-Predicting approval status for new applications

# Target users

This project is useful for:

1. Banks and financial institutions:
   To make faster and more consistent loan decisions.

2. Loan officers:
   To assist them with initial screening of applications.

3. Students and ML beginners:
   To learn how machine learning is applied in finance.
